    <h1 class="title-firtstArticle">The greatest enlightenment I have been discovering</h1>
    <p>
        Hello readers! Welcome to our first article in the Journals category. <br><br>

It’s me, Leona.<br><br>

The reason I come to this article is that it was about a week ago, in the silence of the night while my wife and daughter had slept, I was next to them and thought of a variety of things on Earth such as my jobs, my motorcycle, our future, etc.<br><br>

In a moment, I thought that I should do meditation, which is the best way at that time to help me sleep without stress.<br><br>
<img class="img-firtstArticle" src="img/the outcome is enlightenment.png" alt="article"><br><br>    

Entire the procedure of meditation took place in two minutes, which might be a game changer of my life forever.<br><br>

Just a few minutes, I was enlightened, and this article will delve deeper into my “meditation time” in which I have come up with various emotions like fear, worry, depression, and above all: enlightenment.<br><br>

<h2>PROCEDURE OF ACHIEVING SOME ENLIGHTENMENT</h2>
    <p>Looking at the title you can see that the reaction of the procedure consists of four components: mindfulness, Stoicism, fear and enlightenment.<br><br>

Now you and I will go through each component that helps you feel all the stuff I have been through.<br><br></p>

<h3>BEGINNING WITH MINDFULNESS</h3>
<p>Maybe you've heard this word a thousand times in meditation courses or all stuff about meditation and reduction of stress.<br><br>

According to Cambridge Dictionary, “mindfulness” means the practice of being aware of your body, mind, and feelings in the present moment, thought to create a feeling of calm.<br><br>

In order to practice mindfulness you have to bring your attention back to the present, that is the key point.<br><br>

Then you need to practice breathing, if you are in the first time doing this, it could be hard to you, but you are need of keeping practice until having the ability to control your breath smoothly.<br><br>

When all stuff has been prepared, your job is just to sit and focus on your breath, gradually breathing in then out.<br><br>

In case your mind wanders, just gradually bring it back without judgment then continue the procedure.<br><br>

At the night I was lying next to my family, I completely reached it.<br><br>

Thus, you have finished the first part of the procedure.<br><br>

Now, let’s move to the next.<br><br></p>

<h3>THE SECOND PART IS STOICISM</h3>
<img class="img-firtstArticle" src="img/Stoicism in enlightenment.png" alt="article">
<p>Recently, Stoicism has emerged widely throughout the world, which is a kind of philosophy leading people to better lives or their pain reduction.<br><br>

There are a variety of ways of practicing Stoicism.<br><br>

That night, however, I chose the most challenging way - Negative Imagination.<br><br>

In case you do not know this way of practice, Negative Imagination means you think of the worst situation in which all the worst issues come to you in a way you do not know how to remedy.<br><br>

The purpose of this is that you imagine your life in a bad way, and if you desire not to let it happen, you must find all the solutions to solve it. Then you would love that thing or people more than you do before.<br><br>

During mindfulness time, I completely focus on the imagination of the lack of my wife and daughter.<br><br>

Everything took place in just two minutes, when it was done, I felt like I had experienced the biggest loss that I hadn't felt before.<br><br>

I was surrounded by depression, anxiety, worry, and above all - fear (I will mention in the next part).<br><br>

After the most terrifying experience, I decided to spend more time with my family instead of staring at screens all the time as well as reducing work.<br><br>

So, those are something about Stoicism that I have been practicing for a year.<br><br>

Now we are moving to the third part, which may be the worst part in the chain reaction.<br><br></p>

<h3>THE WORST PART OF THE CHAIN REACTION - FEAR</h3>
<img class="img-firtstArticle" src="img/Enlightenment discovery.png" alt="article">
<p>I can assure that fear is a thing that you would feel after practicing Negative Imagination.<br><br>

In your opinion, which result does fear bring to you after practicing Stoicism? Good or bad?<br><br>

According to my experience, there are both good and bad things coming to you.<br><br>

In this part I will discuss the bad one, the other will be discussed in the next part.<br><br>

Aforementioned, a variety of negative feelings would come to you when you finish your practice, such as depression, anxiety, worry. I am truly sure you would be uncomfortable.<br><br>

Some researches illustrate that people who have been through those feeling may feel absolutely bad, someone even commit suicide.<br><br>

So, to master this skill, you have to use baby steps - one by one - to approach gradually.<br><br>

Beginning with a device like your laptop.<br><br>

Imagine that it is broken, it contains all the files you have and you are going to have a presentation this afternoon.<br><br>

You cannot present without your laptop.<br><br>

Then you are fired, lose your jobs, cannot pay your bills.<br><br>

It is bad, right?<br><br>

But remember! Just imagine.<br><br>

If you are afraid of losing your job because of this, the natural reaction in your body will inform you that you need to love your laptop, you have to use it as carefully as possible, it will never be broken and you will never lose your job.<br><br>

After reaching mastery, you can change to something more available than your laptop.<br><br>

The highest level is your loved one.<br><br>

Be careful with your choice, you just try it whenever you are so familiar to something-not-human.<br><br>

And that is the bad side of fear.<br><br>

Now we go to the other side - the enlightenment.<br><br></p>

<h3>ENLIGHTENMENT - BRIGHT SIDE OF FEAR</h3>
<p> This is the outcome of all the chain reactions.<br><br>

I imagined that I would lose my family: my wife, my daughter; just me in the room, seeming like I would never see them again.<br><br>

The strongest feeling I could feel is empty, lonely.<br><br>

I almost cried.<br><br>

But then, another strong feeling came to me, which I can feel as a positive feeling.<br><br>

It is love.<br><br>

I had thought that I would be ok when my family left me.<br><br>

But I have been wrong.<br><br>

At that time, I loved them so much, more than I can say or feel before.<br><br>

It felt like if there were not my family, I wouldn’t be able to go on with my life.<br><br>

Having them is having me and vice versa.<br><br>

That is the biggest enlightenment I have found out, which surely is a game changer for my life and my family.<br><br>
And there will not be any excuses to keep my eyes on screen while my family is beside me.<br><br>
<img class="img-firtstArticle" src="img/lets enlighten with me.png" alt="article">
<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
<p>It is not going to be easy to enlighten this.<br><br>

    You may be easy with the first part of chain reaction, but Stoicism is the hare one.<br><br>
    
    Practicing is not too difficult, the uncomfortable feeling you meet while doing is the big problem.<br><br>
    
    If you desire to continue, just try harder.<br><br>
    
    However, if something goes wrong, STOP IT as soon as possible.<br><br>
    
    Ok this is the end of the article.<br><br>
    
    Hope you enjoy my first journal.<br><br>
    
    See you next.<br><br>
    
    Love you all.<br><br>
    
    Leona.</p></div>
